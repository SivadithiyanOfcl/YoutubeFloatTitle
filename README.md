# YoutubeFloatTitles
YouTube Float Title is a free and open source chrome extension which allows you to display the title of the YouTube video even in full screen mode!!

##Current Version details
#### Title: YouTube Float Titles
#### Version: 1.0.0
#### Manifest version: 3.0

## How does it works
Chrome extensions can do pretty much anything within a website as long as the appropriate permissions are available.
My extension takes the title of the webpage (title of the page on the video, the one that you see on the tab!! **Even though the title of the webpage is same as the title of the video for most times**)

So whenever there is a change within the YouTube page, the float title will automatically update the text content without need to refresh.
You can also click and drag the title around the screen according to your wish and you retain the title even if you are watching the video in fullscreen.
This comes in handy if you are a streamer and if you want to display the video title without exiting from the fullscreen view/pausing the video often.  

## How to set it up!
This is pretty easy to set-up.
Since I'm not that financially active, I couldn't host this extension in the chrome webstore.
But I'm willing to open source it, you are free to modify the way you want and add anything as you wish. Wish me all the best so I can secure my bag by getting a job (Hopefully).

Follow these steps to properly set-up the chrome extension!

Step 1: Download this entire repository by clicking the "Code" button (the green one!) and click the "Download ZIP" option.

Step 2: Extract the zip file using any software like WinRaR in a desirable position which you can access easily (Desktop or Downloads for example).

Step 3: Head over to your chrome web browser and click on the "Extensions" icon (Puzzle Piece on the same level as the top search bar).

Icon may look something like this:  ![extension](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113179307/215277532-819063d7-9ae2-4c80-b7ed-9e56bec064ec.PNG)

Step 4: Click on "Manage Extensions". A new window tab will pop up!. (or type in **chrome://extensions/** on the url search bar)

Step 5: Turn on the developer mode.

click the "Load Unpacked". This will allow you to load your own extensions locally.

Step 6: Now head over to the location where you have the zip file extracted and select the folder entirely.

Step 7: Tada! You are all done. Head over to the YouTube and see it for yourself (Don't forget to turn on the extension).

If you want to remove this extension, simply navigate to manage extension on the extension icon and disable the extension or right-click my extension's icon (a black YouTube icon) and select "Remove from Chrome" and click "Ok" to remove it. You can always load the extension back using the previous steps (Follow from step 3).

## Future Plans

For now the extension is bare-minimum. It can do what it can do but customization is very limited. As for the last version (version 1.0.0), you can only move the title around and that's that.

I'm looking forward to add the following features to this extension in the future

1. Ability to customize the font style.
2. Ability to customize the size and color of the font.
3. Add a translucent background for the text to make it more appealing and no so simple.
4. Pusblish this extension to chrome dev (Duh!) 

## Remarks

Special thanks to [INHUMAN](https://www.youtube.com/@inhuman.society) for being the inspiration for this project. 
In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnMvPj9prFg&t=206s) @ 3:26 INHUMAN was asking his colleague to make the title visible whenever a video is playing.
This became the source of insipration for this project. 

Also a special thanks to alvistse#6558 on discord for helping me with doubts.

Shout out to both of 'em.

Happy surfing!
